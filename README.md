AI Interactive Smart Doll - Backend API
Welcome to the backend repository for the AI Interactive Smart Doll, a sophisticated conversational AI designed to be an engaging and educational companion for children.

üöÄ Live Demo
You can test the live version of the AI Smart Doll right now by visiting our Hugging Face Space! The interactive UI is served directly from the backend.

üåü Project Overview
This project provides the core services for a smart, interactive AI. It's built with a modern, scalable tech stack to handle real-time voice conversations, manage user data securely, and provide a persistent, personalized memory for each user.

üß† Core Features
End-to-End Voice Interaction: A complete pipeline that transcribes user audio (OpenAI Whisper), generates a contextual response (Google Gemini), and converts it back to high-quality speech (OpenAI TTS).

RAG-based Conversational AI: Utilizes a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to provide context-aware and non-repetitive answers by searching through past conversations.

Personalized Long-Term Memory: Each child has a dedicated memory space in a Qdrant vector database, allowing the AI to remember and recall past interactions.

Multi-User Architecture: A robust user management system built with a cloud-native PostgreSQL database and SQLAlchemy, supporting secure JWT authentication.

Containerized & Cloud-Ready: The entire application is containerized using Docker for easy, reproducible local setup and is deployed on Hugging Face Spaces.
